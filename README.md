Upon signing in users will be able to make posts and add images. 
The purpose of this app is to create a personal wikipedia-esque.
Users can search for other users to view their blogs.
Blogs can have specific categories to adhere to but it is not required, 
this allows users to have the freedom to turn their blogs into a niche subject blog or a collection of their lives or both!
Users will be able to logout. 

Stretch goals: 
Users will be able to follow each other and communicate beyond their blogs. 
Users will be able to search for other users directly through the search function
